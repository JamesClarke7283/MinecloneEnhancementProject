## Poster Design Guidelines

Based on the 'how_to' resources and example posters, the following guidelines should be considered when creating an effective academic poster:

- **Title and Visibility:** The title should be large, clear, and easily readable from a distance. All main elements should be visible from at least 1.5 meters away.

- **Structure and Flow:** Information should be organized in columns, allowing for a top-down and left-right reading that facilitates an easy follow-through.

- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use headings, subheadings, and a logical order to guide the viewer through the poster content. Important information should stand out.

- **Graphics and Visuals:** Employ high-resolution images relevant to the topic. Graphics should be self-explanatory and accompanied by concise captions if necessary.

- **Color Scheme:** Use a consistent and appealing color palette that enhances the visual impact without distracting from the content. Consider using complimentary, monochromatic, or analogous color schemes.

- **Text Readability:** Use clear, concise text in a legible font size. San-serif fonts are generally recommended for easier reading. Minimize text to focus on key points, using bullet points to improve readability.

- **Audience Consideration:** Tailor the poster to the audience's level of expertise, whether specialists, generalists, or somewhere in between.

- **Balance and Space:** Maintain a good balance between text and images. Leave ample 'white space' to prevent a cluttered look and to make the poster easy to digest.

- **Research and Content Relevance:** Ensure all content, including text and images, directly relates to the research project. Highlight main points, conclusions, and any necessary details for understanding.

- **Iterative Design and Feedback:** Be prepared to revise the poster based on feedback from peers, mentors, or test audiences to ensure clarity and impact.
