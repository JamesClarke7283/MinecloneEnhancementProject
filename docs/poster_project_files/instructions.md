# Mineclone/Mineclonia Enhancement Project

The goal of this project is to enhance the subgame of minetest: Mineclone2. A minecraft like game, similar to Minecraft. The reason for this goal, is to.

1. Promote Online Safety by making mods to prevent bad actors from abuse

2. Promote Education using the game.

3. Make the game more viable as an alternative to minecraft as to bolster the credibility of Free/Libre software games, which have many benefits over the non-free games.

# Work done so far

I have made 14 packages on ContentDB. A distribution platform for minetest content. all of which are compatible with mineclone2.

## Important Mods Worth noting

### Entities Protection

Protects entities from other players inside protected areas in Minetest.
 This mod ensures that only the owners of an area (or those with the 
appropriate permissions) can interact with entities within it. The helps the online safety goal.

### Inventory Admin

Inventory Admin allows players with the `invmanage` privilege
 to view and manage the inventory of other players. This tool is 
particularly useful for server admins or for use in special gameplay 
scenarios.

### Proposals

`proposals` introduces a dynamic and interactive way for 
players to engage in the decision-making process on a server. It allows 
players to propose changes, vote on them, and manage their proposals. 
This is designed to foster community involvement and ensure that players
 have a voice in server developments.

### PVP Toggle

PVP Toggle empowers players with the ability to toggle Player vs Player 
(PVP) interactions, providing a customizable experience in player 
interactions. This tool is ideal for those who prefer a more 
collaborative and peaceful environment or for times when engaging in 
combat isn't desired.

### Server Logs

Shows server logs to privileged users. Can be useful for non owner, who are admins, to see in the logs what player has done what, can be useful to find out the cause of greifing(when people destroy peoples stuff) and other malicious activity.

## Work On the Game itself.

One major change made, was my contribution to MineClone2's Texture Converter script, which converts MineCraft resource packs, into mineclone2/minetest texturepacks.

[#4133 - Overhaul Texture_Converter.py and Conversion_Table.csv - MineClone2 - Mesehub](https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/pulls/4133)

I essentially updated it to work with Minecraft 1.20+ Resource Packs. And added a GUI version of the tool.

# Poster Guidelines

- Academic posters should be considered as colorful abstracts to attract audience and showcase research.

- Make the main title large and all elements visible from 1.5m away to engage viewers from the distance.

- Arrange the poster in easy-to-follow columns, similar to newspaper layouts, for readability.

- Images should be relevant and high-resolution to be clearly visible.

- Use a good balance of images and text throughout the poster area for an aesthetically pleasing and informative design.

- Be considerate of color choices, using complimentary, monochromatic, or analogous color schemes to enhance the poster's visual appeal.

- Keep text clear, concise, and in a legible font size, generally above 24 points for body text.

- Prepare for a diverse audience with varying levels of subject familiarity.

- Ensure the poster is well-structured and contains all necessary components: title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, conclusions, and references.

## Poster Design Guidelines

Based on the 'how_to' resources and example posters, the following guidelines should be considered when creating an effective academic poster:

- **Title and Visibility:** The title should be large, clear, and easily readable from a distance. All main elements should be visible from at least 1.5 meters away.

- **Structure and Flow:** Information should be organized in columns, allowing for a top-down and left-right reading that facilitates an easy follow-through.

- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use headings, subheadings, and a logical order to guide the viewer through the poster content. Important information should stand out.

- **Graphics and Visuals:** Employ high-resolution images relevant to the topic. Graphics should be self-explanatory and accompanied by concise captions if necessary.

- **Color Scheme:** Use a consistent and appealing color palette that enhances the visual impact without distracting from the content. Consider using complimentary, monochromatic, or analogous color schemes.

- **Text Readability:** Use clear, concise text in a legible font size. San-serif fonts are generally recommended for easier reading. Minimize text to focus on key points, using bullet points to improve readability.

- **Audience Consideration:** Tailor the poster to the audience's level of expertise, whether specialists, generalists, or somewhere in between.

- **Balance and Space:** Maintain a good balance between text and images. Leave ample 'white space' to prevent a cluttered look and to make the poster easy to digest.

- **Research and Content Relevance:** Ensure all content, including text and images, directly relates to the research project. Highlight main points, conclusions, and any necessary details for understanding.

- **Iterative Design and Feedback:** Be prepared to revise the poster based on feedback from peers, mentors, or test audiences to ensure clarity and impact.
